                                                             April 25
          April 25, 2008 is the day I was born. My family was happy that another blessing would come into their lives. But,
     when I started attending school, I felt an enormous feeling of enviousness whenever I see my classmates celebrating
     their birthdays. Why? Duh, they CELEBRATE THEIR BIRTHDAYS IN SCHOOL. I was so frustrated that I would rant to my mom
     about why my birthday is in April. I remember myself crying, in rage, disappointed that it even led to requesting my 
     mom to change my birthday to some date that would have the opportunity to celebrate the occasion in school. I have 
     dropped hundreds of tears, consumed hours of my time, wasted my voice, because of this and throughout my ‘mental 
     breakdown’, my mom would just laugh. 
     
                                                      THE BEST SPAGHETTI EVER!! 
          My dad makes the best spaghetti ever. Growing up, it is truly a tradition to cook spaghetti in our family whenever 
     there is a special event. And my father would make it. Matter of fact, I have just come to the conclusion that throughout 
     the time of tasting that al dente pasta, meaty and thick sauce, and tasty herbs— THAT EVERYTHING IS CONSISTENT! But, of 
     course, I have tasted a lot of different kinds of spaghetti my whole lifetime, from birthdays, baptisms, to fiestas and 
     my dad still has the best recipe AND I WOULD FIGHT FOR IT. My dad's spaghetti ingredients were never flimsy. Actually, 
     it has a lot of ingredients and he is frankly picky with choosing the right brands and essentials. In conclusion, I 
     love my dad’s spaghetti.
